# Couple Finance Tracker 
## Tinaishe K. Capstone Project
Managing finances as a couple can be difficult, particularly when conventional financial tools are made for individual use.  Many couples try to balance income, track expenses, and save for joint goals without a centralized platform that supports collaboration. 
Instead, they depend on verbal agreements, spreadsheets, or text messages, frequently resulting in misunderstandings, excessive spending, and disagreements.  These issues can strain the relationship, especially when financial responsibilities are not clearly defined or equally shared.

Creating a web-based application, which is a Couple Finance Tracker, is the main business opportunity offered here. It is intended to assist couples in managing their individual and shared financial activities in one location. 
The software is designed to help couples work together toward shared objectives like budgeting, vacation savings, or debt repayment, and make financial management more visible and less confusing. 
This software is currently underrepresented in the market, offering a unique chance to address a real-world problem with a targeted solution.
